He lives in a red and white farm house. What used to be his room is upstairs facing over his family's farm. Golden wheat shimmers and waves at him everywhere he looks with little spots of green ever so present. A few outcroppings of tiger lilies sprinkle the land. He likes to open the shades and look out on it all, thinking how the fields have been here for longer than he has. The house as well. His room is painted light olive green and the paint is chipping off. When disturbed it flutters softly to the ground exposing its white underbelly. It crinkles in a hand and separates into little pieces. He has a picture frame containing a polaroid with his dad and grandparents. It shows them posing in front of the barn arms around each other, all smiling. He thinks about the photo, think how hard it mustâ€™ve been at first. Above his bed he has his bookshelf and a water jug. It's at just the right height to wake up and hit your head on so he developed the habit of rising slowly or not at all. When he was young his dad told him that water was the most gifted resource one could have so he always kept a jug above in case he ever needed a sip. After all, temperatures were so high that his dad once told him he saw the wood start to smoke. He kept 2 blankets in case he needed to put out a fire. He always believed what his dad said. When he went to college he started bringing back home a lot more books, mostly textbooks but some from the old library as well. The dust brushes off like a blanket, sweeps up into the air and swirls. You never know what you could find. He had a pencil box with some leaves inside, it reminded him of nature when in the class. Nature is important. When he came back to say bye to his ma, he put something in his room for her to remember him by. He forgets what it was but he's sure she appreciates it.
