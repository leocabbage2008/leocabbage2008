        Leo Ling is currently in high school. He enjoys writing and finding new
        ways to articulate feelings using words. He likes thrilling or horror
        pieces and enjoys psychological thrillers. In his free time he reads and
        likes to go outside to bike or run or do whatever. His teacher told him
        to write this in third person so it is not a hired writer. Hooray!
