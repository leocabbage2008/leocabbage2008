Place where I exist
I live in my house on ███████ in █████████████████████. I have 11 windows in my house and have opened all but one. The window lies in a room upstairs. It is approximately 15 square meters with a ceiling that is around 2 meters high. The window appears to display a factory to the rear of the house. There is no wallpaper. There is no wallpaper. I have never opened the window in that room. The window is likely not to ever have been opened. There is nobody that lives in that room room. The room has blue wallpaper filled with clouds. It is unknown the exact size of the room but echolocation in natural animals is unfunctional. Walls inside are approximately 200m high and have blue wallpaper filled with clouds. Somebody lives in the room. The windows are all opened. It makes no difference if they're closed. They lead to nothing. The room has blue wallpaper filled with clouds. Somebody lives in the room.
